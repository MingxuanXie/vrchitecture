'VR-chitecture'-or virtual architecture, is the art/discipline of designing buildings that are never meant to be built��the virtual building is not merely a representation of an object-to-be, but the object itself. It is not built in bricks and mortar because there is no need: it serves its purpose better in its non-material form.

      <a-entity position="-6 2.3 1" bmfont-text="text: At the same time, more than half of the global population lives in urban areas rising numerous environmental and social problems (Williams et al, 2008). Things like pollutions, global warming, traffic issues and limited land use are challenging our urban development. Fortunately, the digital revolutions are offering us hopeful alternatives. Travel is no longer the only option to go, thus traffic pollution could also reduce. People do not need to work together in big office buildings anymore, we now collaborate online all the time. We human beings are rapidly evolving ourselves through digital technologies, probably even faster than our cities. Our brain is now augmented with either computer software or phone apps. Half of the total human beings are now connected in a giant cyberspace called internet, solving problems that used to take ages. Conventional architecture and urban patterns have lost their necessity. On the contrary, the growth of cyberspace is inevitable (Kelly, 2016).;

      <a-entity position="1 1.9 -3" bmfont-text="text: Yes, architects are using digital software to design and simulate space, creating better projects. Yes, our buildings are equipped with wired/wireless networks, allowing residents to be connected to cyberspace. But our buildings themselves are not online at all, when everything else are somehow connected to a network including cars, and even shoes where is our architecture in the cyberspace? Of course, they exist but they are not built by our architects�� hands. Architecture in cyberspace have long been developed since the first three dimensional first-person-shooter game, DOOM released in 1993 (Spiller, 1998). Game developers and artists have built thousands of buildings and cities in cyberspace, and they encouraged the players to build even more in games like Minecraft. Real world architects are too relaxed practicing as their one of the oldest traditional professions, creating what themselves think is 'new' and 'interesting' but ignoring (and even criticizing) the truly new breakthroughs in modern technologies, the internet and cyberspace.;

      <a-entity position="-5 -3 4" bmfont-text="text: 1.	Dematerialization - _rchitecture does not need physical materials thus not limited by them (Mitchell, 1999). Instead you can create virtual things that follows your own logic.
2.	Demobilization - Location no longer matters. All things and human are connected through internet with virtually no distance.
3.	Digitalizing architecture to unleash the true power of AI for Intelligent operation of cyberspace - thus creating highly dynamic form of space.
4.	Mass customization/personalization are possible for every cyberspace resident through the help of AI (Mitchell, 1999). At the same time, everyone can easily modify it on its own way.
5.	Designing as a service/platform to achieve highly dynamic customization. Like YouTube, people in cyberspace subscribe to their favorite _rchitects for most up to date design instead of purchasing a one-off project (since _rchitecture is too easy to be copied).
6.	Including three-dimensional user interface design, all design and art forms emerged into one. All things designed and created in cyberspace are _rchitecture
7.	_rchitecture is about 'E-topian' and cyborg life for future humanism. For the young generation born in digital age, emerging into internet and living in cyberspace are inevitable.
8.	_rchitecture also follows the idea of non-plan, prosumer, open source and digital socialism (Kelly, 2016). Sharing of knowledge, designs, tools, methods and ideas. Anyone can learn anything and become what they want to be. It's a new level of Freedom. Anyone can create _rchitecture. Anyone can be _rchitect. ;

      <a-entity position="4 -2.5 -3" bmfont-text="text: 1.	_rchitecture is anti-architecture, anti-skyscraper, anti-metropolis and anti-urbanization. Unnecessary buildings are not only a waste of time and money, but also harmful to the environment. Instead _rchitecture utilizes existing buildings and systems (Bratton, 2009).
2.	Against Any form of political, economic and urban centralization (Barlow, 2017).
3.	Against governments, authorities, regulations, rules, both physical and non-physical boundaries (Barlow, 1996).
4.	Against the idea of standardization and mass production in modern architecture.
5.	Against the situation of keeping knowledge not digitalized online and not allow open access. 
6.	_rchitecture challenges today's academics and education systems including the architecture education. It is against the situation that knowledge kept in academic institute, and not open to everyone. 
7.	Against representation - the representation becomes the space itself. It's the end of medium (Baudrillard, 1994), and the death of modern architects that only work on and produce representations instead of delivering the finished products.
8.	The physical world - we are glad to leave it behind. It is the last and only limit of space. Only by leaving the physical world can we truly understand space in a new era.
